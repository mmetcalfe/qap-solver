This work compared four metaheuristics based on recent approaches from the literature to solving the QAP.
These methods included a memetic algorithm, BMA, a non-population based iterated search method, iterated tabu search (ITS), simulated annealing (SA), and a simple evolutionary algorithm without a local search method (EA).
The four methods were implemented by the author and compared in an experiment using the full set of QAPLIB problem instances.
The results of the experiment indicated that the BMA implementation significantly outperformed the other algorithms.
The simple evolutionary algorithm without a tabu-list or local-improvement method was found to be the least effective.
The simulated annealing implementation performed surprisingly well, achieving a mean deviation from the best known solution similar to the ITS implementation.
Given the status of ITS in recent literature as a formidable approach to solving the QAP, it is suspected that the implementation may be incorrect.
Alternatively, the additional optimisations to the neighbourhood solution evaluation procedure that were omitted from the implementation created for this work may be essential for the algorithm to perform effectively.

The comparatively good results achieved by the BMA algorithm indicate that it may be a promising focus for future work.
