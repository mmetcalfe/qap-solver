\subsection{Implementation details} {
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The algorithms were written in Rust and compiled with rustc 1.3.0 and cargo 0.5.0
        \item Experiments were run on an early 2013 Macbook Pro 15'' with a \SI{2.7}{\giga\hertz} Intel Core i7 processor and \SI{16}{\giga\byte} of RAM
        \item The neighbourhood evaluation acceleration due to \citet{Frieze:1989iv} was not used for ITS and BMA
    \end{itemize}

\subsection{Experiment results} {

    Experiment results averaged over all QAPLIB problems:

    \begin{tabularx}{1.0\textwidth}{@{}l|rrr@{}}
        \toprule
        Algorithm & Deviation (\%) & BKV Time (s) & \% BKV Solutions \\
        \midrule
        SA  &  7.40 & 2.70 & 22.22 \\
        ITS &  6.88 & 0.29 & 18.52 \\
        BMA &  0.63 & 0.52 & 67.41 \\
        EA  & 10.54 & 0.60 &  9.63 \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabularx}

\subsection{Significance tests} {
    Wilcoxon signed rank tests on the \% deviation from the BKV:

\subsection{Discussion} {
    This work compared four metaheuristics based on recent approaches from the literature to solving the QAP.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item BMA significantly outperformed the other algorithms
        \item The evolutionary method without a tabu-list or local-improvement method was ineffective
        \item Simulated annealing performed surprisingly well / ITS may be have implemented incorrectly
    \end{itemize}

    % TODO: Showed that X showed promise for future research.
    % TODO: The memetic algorithm outperformed the classical approaches.
    % TODO: Tabu search performed well.
